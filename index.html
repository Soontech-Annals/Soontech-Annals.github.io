        <h2>What is Encoded Storage?</h2>
        <p>
          An encoded storage is a system that uses redstone signals to sort and store items in Minecraft. By melding
          principles
          from computer science, industrial engineering, and logistics, encoded storage systems allow you to automate
          your item
          management like never before.
        </p>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>Extremely fast sorting using dynamic sorting methods and parallel processing</li>
          <li>Remote call systems that allow you to access your items from anywhere in the world through point to point
            networks</li>
          <li>Autocrafting systems that manufacture your supplies automatically</li>
          <li>And much more!</li>
        </ul>
